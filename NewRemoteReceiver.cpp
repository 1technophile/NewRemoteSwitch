Protocol. (Copied from Wieltje, http://www.circuitsonline.net/forum/view/message/1181410#1181410,
but with slightly different timings, as measured on my device.)

T = short period of ~260µs. However, this code tries
to figure out the correct period

A full frame looks like this:

- start pulse: 1T high, 10.44T low
- 26 bit:  Address
- 1  bit:  group bit
- 1  bit:  on/off/[dim]
- 4  bit:  unit
- [4 bit:  dim level. Present of [dim] is chosen, but might be present anyway...]
- stop pulse: 1T high, 40T low

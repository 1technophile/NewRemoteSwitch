/**
* NewRemoteTransmitter provides a generic class for simulation of common RF remote controls, like the A-series
* 'Klik aan Klik uit'-system (http://www.klikaanklikuit.nl/), used to remotely switch lights etc.
*
* This class is meant for new-style remotes, usually accompanied by receivers with "code learning"
* capabilities. For other remotes, use the RemoteTransmitter class.
*
* Hardware required for this library: a 433MHz/434MHz SAW oscillator transmitter, e.g.
* http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10534
* http://www.conrad.nl/goto/?product=130428
*
* Notes:
* - I measured the period length with an oscilloscope, using a A-series KAKU transmitter. Other devices
*   or manufacturers may use other period length. Use the ShowReceivedCodeNewRemote example to find the
*   period length for your devices.
* - You can copy the address of your "real" remotes, so you won't have to learn new codes into the receivers.
*   In effect this duplicates a remote. But you can also pick a random number in the range 0..2^26-1.
